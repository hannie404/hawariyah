I was born on January 04, 2006 in Amai Pakpak Medical Center (APMC). My mother’s name is Rocaya M. Agor, while my father’s name is Abdulhakim 
C. Agor. I have two elder sisters namely Raishah and Hatmah and I also have an elder brother named Mohammad. I live in Piagapo, Lanao Del Sur and I also 
stay in our apartment located in Bario Datu Saber, Marawi City due to my mother, sister, and brother’s work. <br><br>

I grew up with weak immune system. I was born with an asthma condition which made me visit the hospital every now and then. Due to this condition, I could not 
tire myself out or expose myself into extremely cold or hot environment. I am  also sensitive when it comes to smoke, dusts, and dirty air because it triggers my 
asthma. Upon growing up, I also experienced having pneumonia and dengue. <br><br></p>

When I was born, my siblings were excited about having a baby sister because of the large age gap. During that time, my sisters were 18 years old and 16 years old, 
while my brother was 12 years old. Unfortunately, my father was not around when I was born due to his work overseas. Since my mother was also working, I was mostly 
with my siblings especially with my second sister while growing up. My sister took care of me, fed me, bathed me, and tucked me into bed. Although it was my sister who is
always around, I still have a close bond with my other siblings and my mother. It was just that my other sister was busy with her studies, my brother was also ‘busy’ 
with his studies, and my mother was working. <br><br></p>

I was only three years old when I met her father for the first time, however I did not recognize him as a father because I was not aware of what a father was. 
Because of this, I was constantly trying to drive him away and only called him as “stranger man.” It was not until when I was in kindergarten that I finally understood 
the role of a father. Since then, I have always begged our father to quickly come home. Finally, I was in third grade when I officially met my father again and 
everyone could say that I was instantly a papa’s girl. I was in 7th grade when my father finally came home for good which made me expectedly happy. They tried to 
surprise me with it, but I surprisingly already had a hunch about it, so I was not that surprised, but I was still happy. <br><br></p>

I was in 8th grade in high school when the pandemic happened. It was due to this that we had to take online classes. However, due to some reasons, I had depression. 
Since it was forbidden to go out of one’s house during the pandemic, it only worsened my condition which eventually affected my school works and relationship with 
people. When there was a review for SHSEE, I barely attended my classes due to anxiety. Even when face to face classes were announced to be implemented for the academic year 2022-2023, it made me panic and did not know how to interact with people. 
It was hard to adjust, but I eventually did. Things slowly were put into their right place and I was able to slowly cope and heal myself. It was a hard battle, but it is not impossible to overcome. I still struggle today, but not as worse as before. I am now in 12th grade in senior high school and it is hard, but it is bearable.

I spent my entire kindergarten and elementary years in Philippine Integrated School (PIS) located in Bangon, Marawi City. It was near to our apartment and 
provides a decent quality of education, so it was convenient for my family especially when they have to pick me up. Although when I was in elementary, I go to 
school and go home with my first cousin, Rainisah, because she was also enrolled there during her high school and senior high school years. <br></p>

During my junior kinder year, I was able to attain a decent rank in our class which made me a part of the speed class in my senior kinder year. All of the 
students in speed class were given the opportunity to skip first grade which my mother grabbed because according to her, it would save more money. All throughout 
my kinder and elementary years, one could say that I was an academic achiever. During 6th grade, I passed the entrance exam to enter MSU-ISED SHS and spent my high 
school years there. However, I was no longer academically competitive. I was more relaxed, took my academic tasks easy, and doesn’t pressure myself, so I graduated as 
an average student. Time passed and when I was in 10th grade, I took the Senior High School Entrance Examination (SHSEE) in MSU and passed. I then continued my 
studies in MSU-Marawi Senior High School and is currently Grade 12 under STEM strand. </p>
